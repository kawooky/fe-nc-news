General Info:
-This project was created during my time on the NorthCoders boot-camp.
-This website is an example of a social news website and forum where content is socially curated and promoted by site members through voting.
-This front end project uses my hosted api from the back end project (backend repo and hosted api link below) to make GET, POST and PATCH requests.
-My react app uses browser router to change elements according to the path.
-It also uses concepts such as optimistic rendering, useState and useEffect.
-Features of the app include adding a comment to an article, voting up or down, filtering articles and selecting a user.
